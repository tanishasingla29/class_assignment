The Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are two essential components for working with Java. The JRE is responsible for running Java applications; it contains the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the core libraries needed to execute Java bytecode. However, it doesn’t include development tools like a compiler. That’s where the JDK comes in—it includes the JRE along with tools such as the Java compiler (javac), debugger, and other utilities necessary for writing and building Java programs. When you write code in Java, the compiler (javac) translates the .java source files into .class files containing bytecode. This bytecode is platform-independent and is executed by the JVM, which acts as an interpreter, reading and executing each line of bytecode during runtime. So, the compiler handles translation during development, while the interpreter ensures the program runs as expected on any machine with a JVM. This dual-stage process is a key reason Java is considered both compiled and interpreted.
